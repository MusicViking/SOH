Smart Odisha Hackathon

Theme - Education 

Problem –
Lack of alumni tracking and poor alumni interaction among students who have graduated from educational institutions across Odisha.

Details – 
Universities, schools, and other educational institutions in Odisha do not have the infrastructure to track alumni and facilitate alumni interaction. Every year when students graduate from different institutions across Odisha, some of them register as alumni, however, there is no single platform for them to register, network, and communicate among themselves as well as with their alma mater.

Expected Solution – 
Your solution must contain the following features:
• Information on students who have graduated from 10th, 12th, graduate, postgraduate, and doctorate degrees must be captured.
• A single, bi-lingual platform for the alumni to register and facilitate interaction among the alumni as well as with their alma mater.

Stakeholders – 
• Public
• Government
• Institutions including schools, colleges, universities, etc.
